## Description

This landing page design is for a fictitious data storage company. The illustrations mimic the aesthetic for the entire site: rounded vectors, playful colours and easy-on-the-eye.

## Target

This mockup could easily be the homepage. See if you can build it within the `webroot` folder :)

Good luck!
