# mockups-to-websites

Given a set of open-source designs and supporting materials, let's see if we can build webpages from them.

Our students at Onja are currently learning Front-end Development, so these exercises are like a gold-mine, simulating real-world web development.

## For Developers

We have a number of open-source mockups listed below.

Build the necessary HTML, CSS, and accompanying assets to turn these mockups into living, breathing webpages.

1. Fork this repo
1. Decide on a mockup to work on. Look in that directory for instructions and source material.
1. Place all web-content in the `webroot` folder for the mockup you're working on.

## For Designers

Got a mockup you'd like to include in this list of real-world exercises? Please [get in touch](mailto:shaun@onja.org).
